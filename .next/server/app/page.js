The competition reached its peak in 1969 when NASA's Apollo 11 mission successfully landed humans on the Moon. Since then, space exploration has evolved into a collaborative international effort, with the International Space Station serving as a symbol of peaceful cooperation in space research.

This remarkable process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically using the green pigment chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Using sunlight as an energy source, they transform these ingredients into glucose and oxygen. The glucose serves as food for the plant, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. This process is crucial for life on Earth as it provides the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat. Without photosynthesis, most life forms on Earth would not exist. The process also plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, helping to regulate Earth's climate.",questions:[{id:1,text:"Where does photosynthesis occur in plant cells?",choices:["In the nucleus","In the chloroplasts","In the mitochondria","In the cell wall"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain the chlorophyll pigment.",supportingTextRange:[116,181]},{id:2,text:"What are the main ingredients needed for photosynthesis?",choices:["Oxygen and glucose","Carbon dioxide and oxygen","Carbon dioxide and water","Water and glucose"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil for photosynthesis.",supportingTextRange:[182,246]}]}];function p(){let[e,t]=(0,s.useState)(""),a=d.filter(t=>t.title.toLowerCase().includes(e.toLowerCase()));return n.jsx("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 flex flex-col items-center p-6",children:(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"w-full max-w-4xl",children:[(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"text-center mb-12",children:[(0,n.jsxs)(r(),{href:"/",className:"inline-block",children:[n.jsx(c.Z,{className:"w-16 h-16 mx-auto mb-6 text-primary"}),n.jsx("h1",{className:"text-4xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 hover:text-primary transition-colors",children:"Reading Comprehension Practice"})]}),n.jsx("p",{className:"text-xl mb-8 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400",children:"Improve your reading comprehension skills with interactive exercises and immediate feedback."})]}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative mb-8",children:[n.jsx(h.Z,{className:"absolute left-3 top-1/2 transform -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-400"}),n.jsx(l,{type:"text",placeholder:"Search articles...",className:"pl-10",value:e,onChange:e=>t(e.target.value)})]}),n.jsx("div",{className:"grid gap-4",children:a.map(e=>n.jsx(r(),{href:`/game?articleId=${e.id}`,className:"block",children:(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow",children:[n.jsx("h2",{className:"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100",children:e.title}),(0,n.jsxs)("p",{className:"mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400",children:[e.content.substring(0,150),"..."]}),n.jsx("div",{className:"mt-4 flex items-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400",children:(0,n.jsxs)("span",{children:[e.questions.length," questions"]})})]})},e.id))})]})})}},3161:(e,t,a)=>{"use strict";a.d(t,{cn:()=>r});var n=a(566),i=a(8126);function r(...e){return(0,i.m6)((0,n.W)(e))}},4165:(e,t,a)=>{"use strict";a.r(t),a.d(t,{$$typeof:()=>s,__esModule:()=>r,default:()=>l});var n=a(7536);let i=(0,n.createProxy)(String.raw`/home/warenix/code/repo/github/reading-game/app/page.tsx`),{__esModule:r,$$typeof:s}=i,o=i.default,l=o}};var t=require("../webpack-runtime.js");t.C(e);var a=e=>t(t.s=e),n=t.X(0,[255,506,509,705],()=>a(7907));module.exports=n})();
